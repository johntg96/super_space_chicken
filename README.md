# Super Space Chicken  
## A game built with Phaser.js  
  
Super Space Chicken originated as a doodle on my 9th grade English folder.  
Over the years I've drawn this intergalactic flying robotic chicken doodle countless times.  
Now the super space chicken is coming to a device near you!  
  
## General Game Concept  
  
Dodge asteroids as you fly through space, shooting lasers out of the chickens eyeballs, collecting sunflower seeds, and defeating bosses like the Kernel from Kentucky.

## Development  
  
This game is being built with the JavaScript progamming language and the Phaser game engine.  
You can install the project by cloning this repository and then running `npm install`.  
Then start the local development server with `npm run dev`.
